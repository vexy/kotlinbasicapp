# Kotlin exercise
This is an example of a *very basic* android app made in Kotlin.
  
  

## Plot
After the `main` activity launches, it asks user for it's *name*, *age* and *favourite sport*.  
Favourite sport is in form of a list (`Spinner`) with several hard-coded values directly in `R.values`.  
After user makes selection, all data should be visible on another `Activity`.

## Kotlin/Android features
Following is the list of the things contained in source code:
- basic Kotlin programming
  - variable and values declarations
  - `String` array loading and creating
- activity switching using `Intent`
- resource loading
- controls manipulation in Kotlin style (good bye getters and setters ðŸ˜€)
